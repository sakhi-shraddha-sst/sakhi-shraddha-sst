## 📈 Highlights
- Reduced flaky tests by 45% through refactoring core framework modules, introducing retry analyzers, stabilizing Page Object design across web, mobile, and API suites.
- Designed test pyramid for the product, balancing unit, API, UI, and mobile layers, resulting in faster feedback cycles and reduced UI dependency.
- Enabled shift-left QA by building modular automation components that developers could run during local builds, improving detection of API/UI breaking changes.
