# Hi, I'm SAKHI MALI 👋

SDET | Quality Assurance Engineer | Automation Enthusiast

I break things so users don't have to — with empathy, data, and code.

## 🧪 About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: [ a unified automation framework that supports Web (Selenium), Mobile (Appium), and API (Rest Assured) with reusable components, parallel execution, reporting, and CI integration.]
- 🌱 🌱 Focusing on upskilling in: [Playwright, Performance testing, Accessibility testing, AI-driven test automation, Generative AI for QA workflows, and End-to-End automation strategy to elevate quality engineering maturity ]
- 🤝 I love collaborating on: [Selenium/Appium/Rest Assured automation, Java-based framework design, CI/CD pipeline optimization, test strategy, and AI-driven quality engineering.]

## ✅ Testing Focus
- Automation Frameworks: Selenium • WebdriverIO • POM
- API Testing: Postman • REST Assured • SoapUI
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions • Jenkins • Docker 
- Reporting: Allure • Extent • HTML Reports
- Coverage: Unit • Integration • E2E • Contract Testing

## 📈 Highlights
- Reduced flaky tests by 45% through refactoring core framework modules, introducing retry analyzers, stabilizing Page Object design across web, mobile, and API suites.
- Designed test pyramid for the product, balancing unit, API, UI, and mobile layers, resulting in faster feedback cycles and reduced UI dependency.
- Enabled shift-left QA by building modular automation components that developers could run during local builds, improving detection of API/UI breaking changes.

## 🧰 Featured Projects
- [Project 1] – E2E test suite with Selenium + Extent
- [Project 2] – API testing framework with contract tests
- [Project 3] – CI pipeline for parallelized testing
